|<?> The staff will roll 3 dices at a time. Then you have to guess. |
| -> BIG: if the total of dice faces is 11 -> 17.                   |
| -> SMALL: if the total of dice faces is 4 -> 10.                  |
|<!> If 3 dices have the same face, the staff will roll again. You  |
|    can't change the prediction.                                   |  
| * You are provided 3 ♥. If you guess wrong, you will lose 1 ♥.    |
