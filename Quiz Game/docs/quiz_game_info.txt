                                    QUIZ GAME
I. Introduction:
    Quiz game is a popular games all over the world. It often appears in schools
as a test. After each lesson, the core will be emphasized and easy to remember 
through a quiz game. In studying, I often use quiz games to review new lessons.
I decided to program this game, which is the third game in the game box because
it is complex enough to think about organizing code and storing data. This game 
is a suitable choice for me to improve them.

II. Program description:
1. Programming paradigm: Object oriented programming.

2. Standard modules: os, random.

3. Functional requirements:
- Show guideline.
- Manage Topic: 
+ Add, edit, delete topic.
+ Add, edit, delete quiz.
- Quizzing: Create test and grading.
- Reviewing: show topic's quizzes with answer.

4. Data storage: txt and JSON file.

5. Software Architecture Patterns: MVC
+ Model: Manage data, logic and rule.
+ View: handle information presentation.
+ Controller: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

Architecture overview:

     View                       Controller                  Model
      |                             |                         |
    HomeView                 HomeController             HomeTopicModel
    GameView                 GameController             GameTopicModel
    ManagementView           ManagementView             ManagementModel
    EditTopicView            EditTopicController        EditTopicModel
    TopicView                                           Topic
    QuizView                                            Quiz
    PreventInvalidInput

    In my implementation, the user's input will be validated in the View to make
the controller thinner. The controller is only responsible for giving commands to
view and the model corresponds to the user input that was validated.

III. Features scalable.
- Quizzing:
 Current Version: All quizzes must have 3 choices and one of them is the correct 
answer.
 Upgrade: The choice quantity can be more than 3 and at least 2 depending on the
question type.

- Delete quiz:
 Current version: Only one quiz delete at a time.
 Upgrade: new features for clearing all quizzes at a time and recovering quizzes
in case the user has a mistake.
