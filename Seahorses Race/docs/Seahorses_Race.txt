                            Seahorse Race

I. Introduction:
    This game is a simpler version of seahorse chess. The maximum number of 
players is two and the seahorse is six for both. In the current version, seahorses
will not kick others in the event of a collision. Because just rolling the dice 
and the seahorse moving will make the game boring. To make it more interesting, 
I will add a new feature to our game called the item box. Boxes will be randomly
distributed and their items and events will greatly affect the outcome of the 
match.

II. Program description:
1. Overview:
- This game doesn't have much behavior manipulation with data like the quiz game.
I just learned about the unit test and want to use this game to practice. After 
first refactoring this game, I realize that writing tests before coding makes me
find it easier to design the program.The total time to develop this game compared
to the quiz game is much shorter.

2. Programming paradigm: Object oriented programming.

3. Standard modules: os, sys, time, secrets, random, unittest.

4. Package structural:
- main: contains game source code.
- tests: contains all unittest.
